1. Annotate all synthetic cells using chromHMM.sh.
2. All chromHMM models and emission matrices for synthetic cells at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stages are provided.
3. Genome-wide annotations for every 200 bp bin for synthetic cells at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stages are included in the file zygoteTo8cell_genome_200bp_anno.zip.
4. A script for the analysis of multivalent states is provided.
5. Develop a machine learning model to identify classifier bins distinguishing between totipotency and pluripotency using randomforest.R.
6. Evaluate the similarity of chromatin annotation between cells at 4-cell stage and 2-cell satge using cramerV.R.
