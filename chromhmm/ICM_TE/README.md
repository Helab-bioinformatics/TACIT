1. Annotate all synthetic cells using chromHMM.sh.
2. All chromHMM models and emission matrices for synthetic cells at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stages are provided.
3. Genome-wide annotations for every 2000 bp bin for synthetic cells are provided with allstage_allregion_2kb_anno_fig5e.rds.
4. Develop a machine learning model to identify classifier bins distinguishing ICM and TE using randomforest.R.
5. Evaluate the similarity of chromatin annotation between meta cells and ICM or TE cells using cramerV.R.
