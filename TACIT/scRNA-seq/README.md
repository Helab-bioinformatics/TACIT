### scRNA-seq analysis
1. Split raw sequening data for each single cell based on oligo dT barcodes, with scripts in the scRNA/00_split single cells folder.
2. Analyze sequencing data including cutting adaptor, mapping to mm10 reference genome, and calculating TPM, with scripts in the scRNA/01_scRNA-QC folder.
